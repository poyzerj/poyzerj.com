<h2>Hello, I'm Joe Poyzer</h2>

<p>I'm a Network Engineer with almost 7 years of experience in managed services, technical support, and network administration. I specialize in designing, implementing, and troubleshooting enterprise networks with a focus on routing, switching, and automation.</p>

<h2>What I Do</h2>

<p>Currently, I work as a Service Desk Engineer III at Mytech Partners, where I deliver Tier III support for complex network issues, assess network architectures, and recommend design improvements. I'm passionate about solving challenging technical problems and staying current with emerging networking technologies.</p>

<h2>My Journey</h2>

<p>My career in IT began in 2019, and I've progressed from hands-on technical support roles to more strategic network engineering positions. Along the way, I've worked across diverse industries including managed services, manufacturing, hospitality, and entertainment, giving me a well-rounded perspective on how networks support different business needs.</p>

<p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Network Engineering and Security from Western Governors University and have earned multiple industry certifications, including Cisco CCNA (currently pursuing CCNP Enterprise), Microsoft 365 Administrator Expert, Fortinet Network Security Professional, and CompTIA certifications in Security+, Network+, and Cloud+.</p>

<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>

<p><strong>Networking:</strong> I have extensive experience with Cisco routing and switching (including Catalyst and Business series), Aruba switches and access points, FortiGate firewalls, and Cisco Meraki. I'm proficient in implementing and troubleshooting routing protocols (OSPF, BGP, EIGRP), VLANs, redundancy protocols (HSRP, VRRP, GLBP), VPNs, and network security features.</p>

<p><strong>Cloud & Virtualization:</strong> I work regularly with Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, Hyper-V, and VMWare vSphere to deliver cloud-connected and virtualized solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Automation:</strong> I leverage Python and PowerShell scripting to automate network tasks and improve operational efficiency, with knowledge of network programmability concepts from my Cisco DevNet Associate certification.</p>

<h2>What Drives Me</h2>

<p>I'm constantly learning and growing in this field. My extensive certification portfolio reflects my commitment to continuous improvement and staying ahead of technology trends. I enjoy the challenge of complex network troubleshooting and the satisfaction of designing robust, scalable solutions.</p>

<h2>Beyond the Terminal</h2>

<p>When I'm not configuring routers or troubleshooting network issues, I enjoy building lab environments to test new technologies and document my learning through this portfolio site.</p>

<h2>Let's Connect</h2>

<p>I'm always interested in connecting with fellow network engineers and IT professionals. Feel free to reach out via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpoyzer">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:poyzerj@live.com">email</a>.</p>
